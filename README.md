Key components:
-	Reckless Behavior Detection Model: Utilized LSTM sequence model in CARLA simulation to detect reckless driving behavior.
-	Authorization and Drowsiness Detection: Implemented computer vision models in a camera module to detect unauthorized access and driver drowsiness.


### Voice Assistant (July 2023)

Developed an interactive and intelligent voice assistant capable of understanding natural language commands and performing various tasks.

### Obstacle Avoider Car (June 2023)

Designed and built a car that can autonomously avoid obstacles using machine learning (Q Learning) and embedded systems (AVR ATMega32).

### Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) Game (December 2022)

Implemented a desktop game using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. Used AI (Heuristic Algorithm) to compete against the player.

### Point of Sale Management System (POS) (Oct-Dec 2022)

Created a desktop application for managing point-of-sale transactions using JavaFX. Developed the database and user interface, and implemented features for managing inventory, generating reports, and processing payments.

### Micro-Computer System (Oct-Dec 2022)

I built a micro-computer using the 8086 microprocessor, gaining insights into computer architecture.

### Cafe Management System (June 2021)

I have developed a C++ console application used to manage client data for a cafe.
